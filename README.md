He\* BEC Toolbox
--------------------------------

Tools and assorted junk (mostly if not all Matlab code) to empower a grad student working in cold atom labs to science the hell out of their night and days!

## TODO
- general: what is this repo meant to be exactly?
    - [ ] tidy it up
    - [ ] document code
- issue: `vecnorm` is a builtin MATLAB function from R2017b
    - [x] rename appropriately --> myvecnorm
    - [x] update all existing calls
